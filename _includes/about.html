          <p>The IFDS Workshop on the Theoretical Foundations of Applied AI will take place August 13–15, 2025, at the University of Washington’s Seattle campus. This workshop brings together a diverse group of theoreticians and applied researchers to explore the theoretical underpinnings behind the successes and limitations of modern AI. Through invited talks and dynamic discussions, we aim to deepen our understanding of foundational principles that drive real-world impact. The workshop is part of the scientific programming of the NSF TRIPODS Institute for Foundations of Data Science (IFDS), a multi-institutional collaboration involving the University of Washington, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, and University of California-Santa Cruz. The workshop is organized with support from IFDS at the University of Wisconsin. We look forward to engaging conversations and new collaborations at the intersection of theory and applications.
